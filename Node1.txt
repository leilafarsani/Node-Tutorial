Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson trainees should be able to:

Define what an API is used for
Use Glitch to deploy and edit express servers
Use npm to start a node server
Explain what express is and what it is used for
Use express to create an API that will accept a GET request that returns JSON
Implement routing to return different resources depending on URL
Implement query params to return different content (?query=ses)

1) API Refresh
2) Intro to Node on Glitch
2.1) Running a Simple Server

TEACHER-LED LIVE CODING EXAMPLE
As a class - try to make a simple express server.

You can pick any theme you like but maybe try

The class' favorite foods
The class' favorite songs
or get ideas from the class!
The server should have one endpoint. When you request the 
data from that endpoint it should give you the whole list
of items that are stored in your node server.

Now let's make a server ourselves from scratch...

Make your own node server on glitch

All trainees should "remix" this one for a simple start:
https://glitch.com/~cyf-simple-express Have them it read 
and modify it to do something different.

Login to Glitch and ‘remix’ this project and rename to be yours
e.g. say "Hello Miles", instead of "Hello Kash"
Make it return an array of strings as json.
Make it return the current time
Advanced: make it return whatever you want! 3 minutes.
