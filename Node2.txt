Node - 2
Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson trainees should be able to:

Define what each part of CRUD is and what it does
Process a GET request using Express and Node to retrieve data from memory
Process a POST request using Express and Node and store data in memory
Process a DELETE request using Express and Node to remove data from memory
Install a third party library using npm

CRUD Continued
So what will we build? we will build a CRUD API. CRUD stands for Create,
Retrieve, Update, Delete. If you think about it, this is what most applications do:

Create some "resources"
Retrieve them (GET them)
Update them
Delete them
Below are three in-class exercises which can be used to
demonstrate parts of the API workshop below.

Workshop
You can use this Express Cheatsheet to help you.

API stands for Application Programming Interface.

Read this description of what an API from How To Geek.

Think of an API like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides
a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each 
dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant’s
kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes.
You don’t know exactly how the restaurant prepares that food, and
you don’t really need to. Similarly, an API lists a bunch of 
operations that developers can use, along with a description of 
what they do. The developer doesn’t necessarily need to know how,
for example, an operating system builds and presents a “Save As”
dialog box. They just need to know that it’s available for use in their app.

An API does not have to be web-based. But in our work, since we are 
doing web development, we will work only with web based APIs, so you
might as well hear the word Web Service, and we will communicate with 
those services using the protocol for Web: HTTP.

CHECKPOINT
Recap what we know about HTTP before continuing.

Workshop Objective
Our API will manage Beyoncé albums:

Create a new album,
Retrieve a list of albums or a single album,
Update an existing album's information
Delete an album
We will build these endpoints:

GET /albums should return all the albums
GET /albums/:albumId should return a single album (that matches the passed albumId)
POST /albums should save a new album
PUT /albums/:albumId should update the album (that matches the passed albumId)
DELETE /albums/:albumId should delete the album (that matches the passed albumId)

3.1 Get All Albums
To get started, let's setup our server so that we can retrieve 
all of the albums at once

EXERCISE
In server.js Add the endpoint for GET /albums.
const albumsData = [
  {
    albumId: "10",
    artistName: "Beyoncé",
    collectionName: "Lemonade",
    artworkUrl100:
      "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music20/v4/23/c1/9e/23c19e53-783f-ae47-7212-03cc9998bd84/source/100x100bb.jpg",
    releaseDate: "2016-04-25T07:00:00Z",
    primaryGenreName: "Pop",
    url: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/PeonBmeFR8o?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0",
  },
  {
    albumId: "11",
    artistName: "Beyoncé",
    collectionName: "Dangerously In Love",
    artworkUrl100:
      "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/18/93/6d/18936d85-8f6b-7597-87ef-62c4c5211298/source/100x100bb.jpg",
    releaseDate: "2003-06-24T07:00:00Z",
    primaryGenreName: "Pop",
    url: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViwtNLUqkMY?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0",
  },
];

app.get("/albums", function (req, res) {
  res.send(albumsData);
});

Test the endpoint with Postman. GET /albums should return a 
JSON reply with the array we specified.

Add another item to the array and test that the GET /albums 
returns three items. (Remember you need to close the server ctrl+c and run it again node server.js)
