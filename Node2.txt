CRUD Continued
So what will we build? we will build a CRUD API. CRUD stands for Create,
Retrieve, Update, Delete. If you think about it, this is what most applications do:

Create some "resources"
Retrieve them (GET them)
Update them
Delete them
Below are three in-class exercises which can be used to
demonstrate parts of the API workshop below.
